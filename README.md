## Overview
Those scripts automates the organization and copying of files from a source folder to one or more destination folders. It classifies files based on their extensions (e.g., CR3, JPEG, JPG, MP4, MOV, etc.) and organizes them into subfolders such as RAW, JPEG, PNG, Video, and Others, while sorting these folders by month within year-based directories.

## Features
- **User-Friendly**: Prompts for source and destination folder paths.
- **Organized Structure**: Sorts files into year and month folders, with user-defined subfolders for each file type.
- **Multi Destination**: You can copy your files into different folders at the same time.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays the progress of file copying in real-time.
- **Summary**: When the script is done you get a summary of the moved files.

- PowerShell 7.4.0 or later.
